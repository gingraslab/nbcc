Centre was formed in 2014 from the amalgamation of two flagship LTRI\n      facilities: The Proteomics Facility for mass spectrometry-based analysis of\n      protein function and the SMART High-Throughput and High-Content Screening\n      laboratory for functional genomics studies. The Centre is a Genome\n      Canada-funded genomics technology platform\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The mandate of the Centre is to assist Canadian and International scientists in\n      their investigation of complex biological networks related to human health and\n      disease by providing access to advanced instrumentation, proven workflows, and\n      world-class expertise in functional proteomics and genomics.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Our beliefs:</h3>\n    <p>\n      We believe that the best approach to understanding the complexities of biological\n      networks is to integrate multiple &apos;omics&apos;.  At the Network Biology Collaborative\n      Centre – we can sequence genomes, measure the expression of the individual genes,\n      associate specific gene expression to specific conditions, functionally define what\n      any gene does, pinpoint the location of its resulting protein in the cell and identify\n      small molecule drugs that bind to the protein and impact its function.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We have devoted considerable resources into building the infrastructure,\n      methodology, and integrative data analysis pipelines to effectively study\n      biological networks, and we will continue to do so as we believe that innovating,\n      improving, and implementing new technology is the best way to maintain the\n      highest-calibre research. And we believe that all research at the NBCC\n      should be performed at this level.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Our users:</h3>\n    <p>\n      As a national platform, we work with users from across Canada and internationally.\n      We accept both small and large-scale projects. We encourage any scientist with\n      a project that could fit our expertise to contact us.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n);\n\nexport default Organization;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ +

DeltaVision Elite microscopes</h3>\n      <p>\n        Our DeltaVision Elite (DV Elite) microscopes can handle most imaging applications,\n        including wide-field fluorescence, time-lapse live cell imaging, multi-point cell\n        tracking and differential interference contrast (DIC). Our DV Elite microscopes are\n        equipped with fast sCMOS cameras and various Olympus objectives (from 10x to 100X)\n        and precision environmental control for long live imaging.\n      </p>\n      <h3>II. DeltaVision OMX platform</h3>\n      <p>\n        Our DeltaVision OMX imaging platform is a state-of-the-art, multimode, super-resolution\n        microscope system representing the next generation of optical microscopy. Our DeltaVision\n        OMX offers simultaneous, fast, multi-channel, super-resolution imaging (120 nm lateral\n        and 340 nm axial resolution, wavelength and optics dependent) using 3D structured\n        illumination (3D-SIM), super fast wide-field acquisition, MONET localization microscopy\n        and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging. It supports fixed and live\n        samples.\n      </p>\n      <h3>III.  Nikon Ti2E/A1R-Multiphoton System</h3>\n      <p>\n        The Ti2E/A1R-Multiphoton is Nikon’s newest confocal microscope equipped with a multiphoton\n        imaging system. In its standard confocal mode, the Ti2E/A1R has 6 laser lines controlled by\n        the A1R hybrid scan head capable of switching between Galvano and Resonant scan modes to\n        balance resolution and speed. The A1-DUG-2 multidetector unit simultaneously detects 4\n        fluorescence channels with filters to detect DAPI, CFP, GFP, YFP, Red and Far red\n        fluorophores. Additionally, a DUT diascopic detector allows transmitted light imaging. Air\n        and water- and oil-immersion objectives from 10x to 60x are available for most imaging\n        needs. The tunable Chameleon Discovery multiphoton laser permits high-resolution imaging\n        of thick specimens including organoids and tissues. The multiphoton excitation is paired\n        with a four-channel episcopic ultra-high sensitivity non-descanned detector for optimal\n        signal capture. Three multiphoton-specific objectives are available. A Tokai Hit stage top\n        incubator system allows live imaging using any modality.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As part of our service, we offer expertise in functional genomics screening using either\n        siRNA or CRISPR reagents as well as automated high-resolution imaging using customized\n        G-slides.

Initially, we will require from users a\n        detailed description of their research program, including, but not limited to,\n        a comprehensive overview of the biological system investigated, the overall\n        objectives pursued, preliminary data, estimated timelines, budgetary considerations\n        and availability of funds and, finally, distribution of roles and responsibilities.\n        Services can be listed and briefly described as follows:\n      </p>\n      <h3>I. Assay design</h3>\n      <p>\n        We provide consultation on the assay design that is the most suitable to\n        address the biological question asked by the user. To this end, the first\n        step typically consists of assessing the screenability of the biological\n        system. Should a given system be considered screenable, we will provide proven\n        expertise to define a cell-free or cell-based assay method with the most convenient\n        and effective combination of features, such as sensitivity, reproducibility,\n        selectivity, speed, and costs. This process is strongly facilitated by our\n        capability to precisely perform multi-step procedures (including separation and\n        ultrafiltration steps) and achieve the widest arrays of detection modes (both as\n        endpoint or kinetic) for assay measurements, which include absorbance, fluorescence,\n        time-resolved fluorescence (TRF), fluorescence polarization (FP), fluorescence\n        resonance energy transfer (FRET), time-resolved FRET (TRF-FRET), bioluminescence\n        resonance energy transfer (BRET), and luminescence.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Our personnel may review and assess, if available, preliminary data to determine\n        whether a benchtop assay protocol may be adapted to high-throughput conditions. To\n        this end, screening parameters as well as budgetary and logistic issues are properly\n        evaluated prior to finalization. If necessary, miniaturization strategies or alternative\n        assay procedures (either direct or indirect) may be proposed and carefully appraised for\n        benefits, drawbacks and overall risks.\n      </p>\n      <h3>II. Access to screening reagents</h3>\n      <p>\n        Compound collections have been acquired from commercial sources and through collaborative\n        programs with other Institutes to tackle specific screening rationales, namely i) the\n        identification of chemical rings or pharmacophores with biochemical, biological or\n        pharmacological properties; ii) the elucidation of molecular mechanisms or signaling\n        pathways associated with a given cell phenotype; and iii) the discovery of innovative\n        or repositioned drugs. To these ends, we can provide access to the following collections:\n      </p>\n      <strong>Chemical libraries</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Approximately 220,000 drug-like chemicals, obtained from several vendors\n          (Maybridge, Chembridge, Asinex, Enamine), designed through computational screens\n          in order to provide lead-like motifs and minimize  promiscuous hitters while\n          enhancing chemical diversity.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          4000 semi-natural compounds to explore chemical space around natural motifs\n          (that is, small molecules decorated around  8 natural scaffolds (500 molecules per\n          scaffold such as (i) quinic acid and shikimic acid, (ii) acidhydroxy proline, (iii)\n          santonine, (iv) dianhydro-D-Glucitol, (v) hydroxy pipecolinic acid, (vi) andrographolide,\n          (vii) piperazine-2-carboxylic acid, and (viii) cytosine).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          A wide-range of biologically- and pharmacologically-active (some are FDA-approved\n          drugs) compounds with an impact on specific molecular targets, cell signaling pathways\n          and/or biological processes (TOCRIS Bioscience (n=1296), LOPAC (SIGMA, n=1280), Spectrum\n          (MicroSource, n=2000), and Biomol (n=360) collections.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Prestwick Chemical collection (n=1120), mostly composed (85%) of off-patent,\n          FDA-approved drugs.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          NIHcollection (n=727), small molecules with a history of use in human\n          clinical trials.\n        </li>\n        <li>480 protein kinase inhibitors.</li>\n        <li>\n          160 morphogens (namely, small molecules with a direct impact on cellular processes).\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <strong>siRNA libraries</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Dharmacon Reversioned siRNA SMARTpool Library, Whole Human siGENOME (~18,150 gene\n          targets) available in the following subset collections: GPCR, Druggable targets,\n          Ubiquitin Conjugation, Ion Channels, Proteases, Kinases, Phosphatases, and\n          epigenetics custom-made collection.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Dharmacon siRNA SMARTpool Library, Whole Mouse siGENOME (~16,500 gene targets)\n          available in the following subset collections: Kinases, GPCR, Druggable targets.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Dharmacon Reversioned Deconvolved siRNA Library, whole Human siGENOME composed of 4\n          siRNA unique sequences for each SMARTpool sample of the Whole Human Genome Library\n          (~72,600 samples).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Dharmacon Deconvolved siRNA Library Whole Mouse siGENOME composed of 4 siRNA\n          unique sequences for each SMARTpool reagent in the Whole Mouse Genome Library\n          (~66,000 samples).\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <strong>miRNA libraries</strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Dharmacon miRIDIAN™ microRNA Mimics (n=810) and Hairpin Inhibitors (n=810) (HUMAN).</li>\n        <li>Dharmacon miRIDIAN™ microRNA Mimics (n=642) and Hairpin Inhibitors (n=642) (MOUSE).</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        In addition, customized collections of any kind and format can be realiquotted for use in\n        specific project upon a user&apos;s request or HTS personnel recommendation.\n      </p>\n      <h3>III. Lab automation setups</h3>\n      <p>\n        We can develop, validate and execute robotic methods that accommodate and fine-tune\n        technical requirements and mechanical aspects necessary to precisely reproduce an\n        experimental protocol previously validated at the benchtop level. During validation\n        of the automation, manual steps are replaced systematically with instruments to ensure\n        accuracy and robustness of the procedure. Once the sequence of events and the corresponding\n        instrumentation are determined, a scheduling program is finalized and subsequently tested\n        in a pilot experiment prior to final acceptance of technical and mechanical conditions\n        (e.g. harshness of washing conditions, flow rates of dispensed liquid, mixing steps etc.).\n      </p>\n      <h3>IV. Data management</h3>\n      <p>\n        We can assist users with data management, that is, the capture, storage and analysis of\n        results. For screens performed in a sequential manner, screening parameters (variability\n        of controls, variability of samples, dynamic range, hit rate) are monitored throughout\n        the entire process to determine consistency of data and whether any screening run should\n        be repeated. The approach for data normalization and hit selection may depend on several\n        factors associated with type, format, duration etc. of any given assay, and the nature of\n        the library used for the screen. Generally, a variety of methods (e.g. control-based, Z-\n        or B-score) is assessed each time to find the most reliable and informative approach for\n        subsequent data interpretation and hit finalization.\n      </p>\n      <h3>V. Cherry-picks, confirmatory tests, and dose-response curves</h3>\n      <p>\n        These are typical follow-up tests after a primary screen that we offer to users as a\n        routine procedure aimed at the definition of a short-list of candidates for subsequent,\n        more stringent validation strategies.\n      </p>\n      <h3>VI. Sample combination arrays</h3>\n      <p>\n        This is a procedure that may offer valuable information to better understand the\n        molecular mechanisms that underlie a given phenotype (using combinations of bioactive\n        molecules). Alternatively, it may be used to discover synergic effects of drugs. Sample\n        arrays may be experimentally challenging due to a large variety of combinations that may\n        arise when different concentrations and different dispensing times are tested. Through\n        advanced robotic capabilities, we can however provide users with this experimental option.\n      </p>\n      <h3>VII. LUMIER</h3>\n      <p>\n        LUMIER (LUminescence-based Mamalian IntERactome) is a high-throughput automated platform\n        developed in the Wrana lab for identification of novel protein-protein interactions in\n        mammalian cells. In this assay, a Luciferase (LUC)-tagged fusion protein is co-transfected\n        with a FLAG-tagged protein in mammalian cells. The interaction between the two proteins is\n        determined by co-immunoprecipitating the FLAG-tagged protein and detecting the LUC-tagged\n        interactor in the complex by its luciferase activity. LUMIER can easily identify\n        transmembrane protein partners, dynamic interactions that are signaling- or\n        isoform-dependent, as well as those that may occur only in the presence of\n        post-translational modifications. The assay can be performed in 96 or 384-well format.\n      </p>\n      <h3>VIII. Kinase inhibitor profiling - Chaperone thermosensor assay using LUMIER</h3>\n      <p>\n        The Chaperone Thermosensor LUMIER assay at the NBCC, adapted from Mikko Taipale,\n        measures the specificity of kinase drugs by screening them against 320 human kinases in a\n        {' '}\n        <strong>cell-based</strong>\n        {' '}\n        assay. In this assay, FLAG-tagged kinases are transfected into HEK293 cells stably\n        expressing Renilla-tagged  HSP90 or its co-chaperone CDC37. A LUMIER assay is performed plus\n        or minus drug. A drug successfully binding to a kinase will stabilize its conformation\n        decreasing its need for the chaperone.

ELISA-based serology assays</h3>\n      <p>\n        Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are a plate-based method to detect binding of antibodies\n        to antigen.  This assay can be employed in high-throughput format on our automated platforms.  For\n        detection of antibodies to SARS CoV-2, we have validated assays to detect IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies\n        against the\n        spike trimer, spike RBD, and nucleocapsid protein.  We also offer a surrogate neutralization ELISA (snELISA) to\n        identify antibodies with neutralizing potential.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n);\n\nexport default Services;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/R.0f40de2f.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/coreflow.3a5fd26a.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SMART_to_KEGG_mapper.df7fb58b.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SMART_to_KEGG_mapper2x.77c21a0b.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SMART_to_KEGG_mapper3x.bffdca64.png\";","import React from 'react';\n\nimport Chart from '../../assets/icons/chart';\nimport R from './assets/R.svg';\nimport CoreFlow from './assets/coreflow.svg';\nimport SMARTKEGG from './assets/SMART_to_KEGG_mapper.png';\nimport SMARTKEGG2x from './assets/SMART_to_KEGG_mapper2x.png';\nimport SMARTKEGG3x from './assets/SMART_to_KEGG_mapper3x.png';\n\nconst Tools = () => (\n  <section\n    className=\"facilities__section facilities__tools\"\n    id=\"tools\"\n  >\n    <div className=\"facilities__section-inner facilities__hts-software\">\n      <h2>\n        <Chart />\n        Analysis tools\n      </h2>\n      <h3>R</h3>\n      <div>\n        <img\n          alt=\"R\"\n          height={50}\n          src={R}\n          width={65}\n        />\n        <p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/about.html\">R</a>\n          {' '}\n          is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.\n          We use the wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling,\n          classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering,\n          ...) and graphical techniques that R provides to custom analyze the data for\n          different projects.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>CoreFlow</h3>\n      <div>\n        <img\n          alt=\"Coreflow\"\n          height={50}\n          src={CoreFlow}\n          width={107}\n        />\n        <p>\n          To organize and analyze data generated from high-throughput screening,\n          we use the in-house developed CoreFlow pipepline.\n          {' '}\n          <a href=\"http://coreflow.mshri.on.ca/TestLab/CoreFlow/index.php\">CoreFlow</a>\n          {' '}\n          provides us with a framework to manage data in real time.

Once stable cell\n        lines are generated expressing the baits of interest, we will perform\n        affinity purification from cell pellets by lysing the cells, purifying\n        the biotinylated proteins using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and\n        digesting the protein into peptides in preparation for mass spectrometry\n        analysis.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Customized affinity purification for mass spectrometry</h4>\n      <p>\n        In addition to our two standardized services, we also offer custom\n        affinity purifications.

In each\n        case, the cost will be determined on a per sample basis calculated after\n        discussion of project design and will include assay setup charges.\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n        <span>II. Mass spectrometry analysis</span>\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        We offer a range of mass spectrometry analyses on high-resolution,\n        high-sensitivity mass spectrometers. The first step in mass\n        spectrometry-based proteomics analysis is the identification of\n        proteins within the sample through discovery analysis using an\n        approach termed &quot;data-dependent acquisition&quot;. If desired, we also\n        offer additional services to quantify the relevant amount of proteins\n        within samples using either comprehensive or targeted approaches.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Discovery analysis - Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA)</h4>\n      <p>\n        Digested protein samples will be analyzed with a high-resolution,\n        high-sensitivity mass spectrometer in a nano-LCMS/MS workflow. Data\n        will be stored in a secure manner within the ProHits mass spectrometry\n        LIMS system, and analyzed with leading search engines and algorithms.\n        In the case of samples for identification, a confident list of protein\n        identifications with peptide details will be reported. In the case of\n        protein-protein interaction studies, the report will include a list of\n        significant interacting proteins (with assigned pValues from the SAINT\n        algorithm) in formats compatible for visualization (e.g. through cytoscape).\n      </p>\n      <h4>Comprehensive quantitative analysis - Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA-SWATH)</h4>\n      <p>\n        For projects where discovery proteomics has been successful and there\n        is a desire to quantify changes in protein composition under different\n        conditions, we will perform relative quantitative analysis. Unlabeled\n        digested protein samples will be analyzed using a comprehensive\n        quantification method (DIA-SWATH) that determines the relative intensity\n        for all peptides above a signal-to-noise threshold within the mixture.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Targeted quantitative analysis</h4>\n      <p>\n        For quantification of a specific set of proteins, peptides or\n        post-translational modifications, we offer targeted quantification analysis, such as\n        multiple reaction monitoring-high resolution (MRM-HR), Targeted SWATH on a Triple\n        TOF mass spectrometer and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on the Lumos. The costing\n        will be determined after the project is defined and will include all assay setup costs.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Labelled quantitative analysis</h4>\n      <p>\n        We also offer the ability to multiplex samples for quantification using\n        SILAC, iTRAQ, and di-methyl labelling. Please contact us to discuss your\n        project and the most appropriate methodology.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Data analysis</h4>\n      <p>\n        For customers who wish more detailed data analysis or our assistance in\n        integrating proteomics data with other data, we offer extended data analysis\n        from our mass spectrometry specialists or our in house statistician.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n);\n\nexport default Services;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nimport Chart from '../../assets/icons/chart';\nimport LinkIcon from '../../assets/icons/link';\n\nconst Tools = () => (\n  <section\n    className=\"facilities__section facilities__tools\"\n    id=\"tools\"\n  >\n    <div className=\"facilities__section-inner\">\n      <h2>\n        <Chart />\n        Analysis tools\n      </h2>\n      <h3>\n        <span>I.

These results were compared to those\n          obtained from an ELISA-based assay using saliva from co-Senior Investigator Jennifer Gommerman at the\n          University of Toronto.  Longitudinal analysis showed that IgG antibodies remained relatively stable for\n          at least 3 months post-symptom onset in both biofluids.  Results for IgG correlated well between saliva\n          and blood suggesting that saliva may serve as an alternative to blood in assessing immune response to\n          SARS CoV-2.\n          {' '}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/52/eabe5511\"\n          >\n            Isho et al. article.\n          </a>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Paper #2:</strong>\n          {' '}\n          <em>\n            A simple protein-based surrogate neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2.\n          </em>\n          {' '}\n          Abe et al., JCI Insight. 2020 Oct 2;5(19):142362, PMID: 32870820.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Graduate student Kento Abe developed a safe and efficient ELISA-based assay for identifying\n          potential neutralizing antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS CoV-2 spike RBD with its\n          receptor ACE2 on host cells.  The results obtained from this high-throughput assay correlated well\n          with the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), a low-throughput assay using\n          live virus that requires biosafety level 3 containment.
