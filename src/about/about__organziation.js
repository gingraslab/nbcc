    <p>
      The Network Biology Collaborative Centre (NBCC) is located at the
      Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI) in Mount Sinai Hospital.
      The Centre was formed in 2014 from the amalgamation of two flagship LTRI
      facilities: The Proteomics Facility for mass spectrometry-based analysis of
      protein function and the SMART High-Throughput and High-Content Screening
      laboratory for functional genomics studies. The Centre is a Genome
      Canada-funded genomics technology platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mandate of the Centre is to assist Canadian and International scientists in
      their investigation of complex biological networks related to human health and
      disease by providing access to advanced instrumentation, proven workflows, and
      world-class expertise in functional proteomics and genomics.
    </p>
    <h3>Our beliefs:</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that the best approach to understanding the complexities of biological
      networks is to integrate multiple &apos;omics&apos;.  At the Network Biology Collaborative
      Centre â€“ we can sequence genomes, measure the expression of the individual genes,
      associate specific gene expression to specific conditions, functionally define what
      any gene does, pinpoint the location of its resulting protein in the cell and identify
      small molecule drugs that bind to the protein and impact its function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have devoted considerable resources into building the infrastructure,
      methodology, and integrative data analysis pipelines to effectively study
      biological networks, and we will continue to do so as we believe that innovating,
      improving, and implementing new technology is the best way to maintain the
      highest-calibre research. And we believe that all research at the NBCC
      should be performed at this level.
    </p>
    <h3>Our users:</h3>
    <p>
      As a national platform, we work with users from across Canada and internationally.
      We accept both small and large-scale projects. We encourage any scientist with
      a project that could fit our expertise to contact us.
