      Genetics, University of Toronto. She holds the Canada Research Chair in
      Functional Proteomics and the Lea Reichmann Chair in Cancer Proteomics.
      In 2011, she was recognized as one of Canada's top 100 most powerful women.
      Her core biological interests centre on signal transduction in cancer and
      vascular diseases. Dr. Gingras is Director of Proteomics and has focused
      on applying mass spectrometry-based proteomics to understanding the assembly
      of proteins into complex signaling networks.`,
