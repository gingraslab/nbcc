            The facilities within the NBCC offer complementary services that when combined can
            provide powerful insight into the control of biological networks. We encourage users
            to consider how their research can be strengthened by integrating several technologies
            offered within the Centre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please contact the centre manager Dr. Karen Colwill to take advantage of integrated
            analyses or speak to the facility managers directly. We will work with you to
            coordinate your experiments and to offer our expertise in network biology data analysis.
