          The Next-Gen Sequencing and Proteomics nodes of the NBCC contributed to a Science paper
          in March by Daniel Schramekâ€™s lab in which his team used reverse CRISPR screens to
          functionally assess rare HNSCC gene mutations in mice. They identified 15 tumour
          suppressor genes that converge on the NOTCH signalling pathway.

        <p>
          The NBCC worked with the McQuibban lab from the University of Toronto on an HTP screen
          that identified Rock inhibitors as potentiators of the Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway
          that is required to remove damaged mitochondria from dopaminergic neurons. This discovery
          may lead to new treatments for Parkinson&apos;s Disease or other diseases characterized by
          mitochondrial dysfunction.

          Jeff Wrana and his team identify a new type of stem cell in the intestine that
          is critical to regeneration of the intestine after damage. Single cell RNA sequencing
          analysis performed in collaboration with the NBCC was key to finding this revival stem
          cell that is only active for 24 hours.
